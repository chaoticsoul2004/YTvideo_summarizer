# YouTube Video Summarizer
## Overview

The YouTube Video Summarizer is a project that utilizes the power of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) to generate concise and informative summaries of YouTube videos. With this tool, users can simply provide a link to a YouTube video, and the system will analyze the content using T5 transformer to generate a summarization in text format.
## Features

`Summarize YouTube Videos`: The primary function of the project is to take a YouTube video link as input and generate a summary in written form.

`T5 Transformer`: The project leverages the T5 transformer, a state-of-the-art pre-trained model designed for text generation tasks, ensuring high-quality and coherent summarizations.

`Streamlit Deployment`: The system has been deployed using Streamlit, allowing for easy access through a web interface.
